ou are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a double booking.

A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a
booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

Implement the MyCalendar class:

MyCalendar() Initializes the calendar object.
boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the
calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
 

Example 1:

Input
["MyCalendar", "book", "book", "book"]
[[], [10, 20], [15, 25], [20, 30]]
Output
[null, true, false, true]

Explanation
MyCalendar myCalendar = new MyCalendar();
myCalendar.book(10, 20); // return True
myCalendar.book(15, 25); // return False, It can not be booked because time 15 is already booked by another event.
myCalendar.book(20, 30); // return True, The event can be booked, as the first event takes every time less than 20, but not including 20.


   TreeMap<Integer, Integer> map;
public MyCalendar() {
    map = new TreeMap<>();
}

public boolean book(int start, int end) {
    Integer left = map.floorKey(start);
    Integer right = map.ceilingKey(start);
    
    if((left == null || map.get(left) <= start) && (right == null || right >= end)) {
        map.put(start, end);
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
}

731. My Calendar II. without causing a triple booking

You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.

A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to all the three events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

Implement the MyCalendarTwo class:

MyCalendarTwo() Initializes the calendar object.
boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully 
without causing a triple booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
 
                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                      class MyCalendarTwo {

  private List<int[]> bookings;
    private List<int[]> overlaps;
    
    public MyCalendarTwo() {
  List<int[]> calendar;
    List<int[]> overlaps;

    MyCalendarTwo() {
        calendar = new ArrayList();
        overlaps = new ArrayList();
    }

    public boolean book(int start, int end) {
        for (int[] iv: overlaps) {
            if (iv[0] < end && start < iv[1]) return false;
        }
        for (int[] iv: calendar) {
            if (iv[0] < end && start < iv[1])
                overlaps.add(new int[]{Math.max(start, iv[0]), Math.min(end, iv[1])});
        }
        calendar.add(new int[]{start, end});
        return true;
    }
/**
 * Your MyCalendarTwo object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyCalendarTwo obj = new MyCalendarTwo();
 * boolean param_1 = obj.book(start,end);

=====================================
  732. My Calendar III
A k-booking happens when k events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., there is some time that is common to all k events.)

You are given some events [start, end), after each given event, 
return an integer k representing the maximum k-booking between all the previous events.

Implement the MyCalendarThree class:

MyCalendarThree() Initializes the object.
int book(int start, int end) Returns an integer k representing the largest integer such that there exists a k-booking in the calendar.
 

Example 1:

Input
["MyCalendarThree", "book", "book", "book", "book", "book", "book"]
[[], [10, 20], [50, 60], [10, 40], [5, 15], [5, 10], [25, 55]]
Output
[null, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3]

Explanation
MyCalendarThree myCalendarThree = new MyCalendarThree();
myCalendarThree.book(10, 20); // return 1, The first event can be booked and is disjoint, so the maximum k-booking is a 1-booking.
myCalendarThree.book(50, 60); // return 1, The second event can be booked and is disjoint, so the maximum k-booking is a 1-booking.
myCalendarThree.book(10, 40); // return 2, The third event [10, 40) intersects the first event, and the maximum k-booking is a 2-booking.
myCalendarThree.book(5, 15); // return 3, The remaining events cause the maximum K-booking to be only a 3-booking.
myCalendarThree.book(5, 10); // return 3
myCalendarThree.book(25, 55); // return 3
                           
                           
                           
                           class MyCalendarThree {
// When booking a new event [start, end), count delta[start]++ 
// and delta[end]--. When processing the values of
// delta in sorted order of their keys, the largest such value is the answer.
    TreeMap<Integer, Integer> delta;

    public MyCalendarThree() {
        delta = new TreeMap();
    }

    public int book(int start, int end) {
        delta.put(start, delta.getOrDefault(start, 0) + 1);
        delta.put(end, delta.getOrDefault(end, 0) - 1);

        int active = 0, ans = 0;
        for (int d: delta.values()) {
            active += d;
            if (active > ans) ans = active;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
