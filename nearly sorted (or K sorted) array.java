Given an array of n elements, where each element is at most k away from its target position,
devise an algorithm that sorts in O(n log k) time. For example, let us consider k is 2, 
an element at index 7 in the sorted array, can be at indexes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 in the given array.

Input : arr[] = {6, 5, 3, 2, 8, 10, 9}
            k = 3 
Output : arr[] = {2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10}

Input : arr[] = {10, 9, 8, 7, 4, 70, 60, 50}
         k = 4
Output : arr[] = {4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 50, 60, 70}

We can use Insertion Sort to sort the elements efficiently
/* Function to sort an array using insertion sort*/
static void insertionSort(int A[], int size)
{
    int i, key, j;
    for (i = 1; i < size; i++)
    {
        key = A[i];
        j = i-1;
 
        /* Move elements of A[0..i-1], that
            are greater than key, to one
            position ahead of their current position.
            This loop will run at most k times */
        while (j >= 0 && A[j] > key)
        {
            A[j+1] = A[j];
            j = j-1;
        }
        A[j+1] = key;
    }
}



We can sort such arrays more efficiently with the help of Heap data structure. Following is the detailed process that uses Heap. 
1) Create a Min Heap of size k+1 with first k+1 elements. This will take O(k) time (See this GFact) 
2) One by one remove min element from heap, put it in result array, and add a new element to heap from remaining elements.
Removing an element and adding a new element to min heap will take log k time. So overall complexity will be O(k) + O((n-k) * log(k)).
  
  import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
 
class GFG {
    private static void kSort(int[] arr, int n, int k)
    {
 
        // min heap
        PriorityQueue<Integer> priorityQueue
            = new PriorityQueue<>();
 
        // add first k + 1 items to the min heap
        for (int i = 0; i < k + 1; i++) {
            priorityQueue.add(arr[i]);
        }
 
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = k + 1; i < n; i++) {
            arr[index++] = priorityQueue.peek();
            priorityQueue.poll();
            priorityQueue.add(arr[i]);
        }
 
        Iterator<Integer> itr = priorityQueue.iterator();
 
        while (itr.hasNext()) {
            arr[index++] = priorityQueue.peek();
            priorityQueue.poll();
        }
    }
 
    // A utility function to print the array
    private static void printArray(int[] arr, int n)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " ");
    }
 
    // Driver Code
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int k = 3;
        int arr[] = { 2, 6, 3, 12, 56, 8 };
        int n = arr.length;
        kSort(arr, n, k);
        System.out.println("Following is sorted array");
        printArray(arr, n);
    }
}
